Bark Bake and Brew Site
This website is a project for Code Louisville in which I am designing a website for a local business Bark Bake and Brew. 

This site will be used for display of products they have created as well as provide a way for customers to connect with local animal charities. Additionally the company will use this to communicate seasonal and / or monthly changes or updates to their customers who are visiting the site.
