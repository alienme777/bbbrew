		<p>At Bark Bake and Brew, our mission is to deliver fun, delicious and high quality treats for our human and animal friends! We use only the finest fresh and healthy ingredients to craft a wide variety of gourmet cakes, cookies and desserts, healthy animal treats, and all at a reasonable cost to you!</p>
		<p>When we opened the doors to Bark Bake and Brew in 2016, we did so with the hope to bring awareness to animal charities in our community and abroad by promoting them with the proceeds from our sales. We continue this tradition today and we are still proud to say that a large portion of every dog treat sale goes directly back to a local animal charity!</p>
		<p>If you are interested in what we can do for your private event or if you would just like to order a bag of tasty treats, please visit our gallery below. If you decide you would like to place an order, please visit the order quote page from the links above</p>
