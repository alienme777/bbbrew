							Project Overview:

							
Bark bake and brew website to represent the business / capabilities. 

							Layout ideas:

-static top bar with limited information

-white background primarily
	-color pallete somewhat a brighter pastel; generally soft pink and greens.
	
-dynamic menu which will adjust to media querries / device display size
	-possibly in header but may have separation of space from top of page. need more thought
	-possibly an ordering contact link, image gallery, event history gallery, etc
	
-standard descriptive content on page. Current events / charity participation

-Link to ordering/contract will be interactive requiring a form for contact submission.

-I like the CSS shadow box model, I plan to incorporate a similar effect to the images on pages.
	-image galleries may use an established lightbox or other method of display which may require configuration to achieve a similar visual effect. More research necessary
	
-footer at the bottom with normal info, perhaps having menu selectors drop into it when media querry specifies mobile devices

-Domain is already purchased and may host site on my work server or rent hosting space long term once it becomes viable. 









							Secondary Project (if I have time):
							
Stumlers machine site to represent their business and handle project inquiries

							Layout ideas:
							

-White background
							
-top menu bar with Stumler logo banner which will link to a contacts page and machine gallery / picture galley

-static informational content on main page 

-contact page with form submission for project quotes and other inquerries

-shop footage for image and backgrounds

-more to come if this see's the light
